Intan RHX release notes
-----------------------

* Version 3.0, 11 February 2021
- First release; started with v3.0 to avoid confusion with older Intan software.

* Version 3.0.1, 12 February 2021
- Fixed bug that caused crash during electrode impedance measurement.

* Version 3.0.2, 24 March 2021
- Improvements to Spike Scope:
   - Added RMS display, consistent with old software.
   - Added spike rate display.
   - Number of spikes in recent spike history can now be as high as 500.
   - Each channel's recent spike history is persistent when channels are changed.
   - Added 'Take Snapshot' and 'Clear Snapshot' buttons to permit freezing spike history in background of display on a per-channel basis.
- Added longer post-trigger spans to PSTH tool: 5s, 10s, and 20s.
- Added ability to use analog inputs as digital triggers in PSTH tool.
- Added ability to use analog inputs as digital triggers in Display Trigger (in Trigger tab).
- Added ability to display thresholded analog inputs as digital signals in Spectrogram Tool.
- In data file playback mode, added 'run immediately' option after 'jump to position'.
- Extended range of y-axis spacing between waveforms on waveform display.
- Fixed bug where 'Stop' button was not working during rewinding.
- Fixed bug where the 'Automatically Save Trigger Channel' option in triggered recording was not working.
- Fixed issue where software crashed upon exiting on some Macs.
- Fixed crashing upon software startup with some smaller screens.
- Improvements to TCP output:
   - Added ability to disable and enable individual channels for TCP output while system is running.
   - Improved TCP parser so that path names and file names may include spaces.
   - Fixed TCP output timestamps to match timestamps in recorded data.
   - Fixed issue where TCP data output could fill up software 'Waveform FIFO' buffer under certain conditions.
   - Changed TCP parameter name 'DisplayTriggerAnalogVoltageThresholdVolts' to 'TriggerAnalogVoltageThresholdVolts'.
- Switched to latest version (v5.2.3) of Opal Kelly DLL.
- Changes to support Linux compilation.
- Windows installer:
   - Fixed issue where certain anti-virus programs would interfere with Windows installation.
   - Added additonal DLLs to Windows installation:
       api-ms-win-core-winrt-string-l1-1-0.dll
       api-ms-win-core-winrt-l1-1-0.dll
       OpenCL.dll

* Version 3.0.3, 15 April 2021
- Added 50 ms option to PSTH pre-trigger and post-trigger spans.
- In "One File Per Signal Type" data file format, added option to save auxiliary inputs (e.g., acccelerometer data) in amplifier.dat file.
- Fixed bug that sometimes causes crashing when PC audio was enabled.
- Fixed bug that did not display auxiliary inputs or supply voltages from second headstage when dual headstage adapter was used.
- Expanded OpenCL compatibility to fix problems with OpenCL initialization on some systems.

* Version 3.0.4, 5 August 2021
- Fixed small memory leak that occurred when saving in the File Per Signal Type file format.
- Improved XML settings file parsing so that files that don't include any headstage channels can still be correctly loaded.
- Minor improvement to make error logging more detailed and efficient.
- Modify episodic triggered recording algorithm to ignore brief trigger-off events.
- Improved optimum SPI delay finding algorithm so that setting delay manually is less likely to be necessary.
- In data file playback mode, electrode impedances are now displayed.
- Fixed issue with external fast settling in RHD systems not properly triggering as a result of digital input activity

* Version 3.0.5, 3 February 2022
- Removed unused Context Help buttons from dialogs.
- Reduced latency of spike .dat file writing so that these files are updated as soon as spikes are detected.
- Added option to start software without OpenCL.
- Improved TCP parsing to handle unexpected whitespace in a string of commands.
- Added WriteToDiskLatency setting for users to control.
- Added CreateNewDirectory setting for users to control.
- Fixed displaying 'save to disk' icon for enabled non-amplifier signals (e.g., aux in, digital in, analog in).
- Fixed small memory leak during TCP data streaming.
- Altered 'Rescan Ports' behavior so that if the system went from no headstages to at least one detected, the displayed port will update to the present chip(s).
- Added drag'n'drop option for various settings files.
- Added more descriptive error messages when a Probe Map file is loaded as a general settings file.
- Fixed bug that would only flag channels as spike-TCP enabled if they were also waveform-TCP enabled.
- Removed unusable 'aux in wideband' checkbox hidden for RHS systems, because they don't have aux in channels.
- Added more descriptive error/warning messages when channels loaded from XML file are inconsistent with those currently plugged in.
- Fixed bug where loading data for playback that had aux inputs saved in wideband file wouldn't parse correctly.
- Fixed bug with external fast settling not properly triggering as a result of digital input activity.

* Version 3.0.6, 1 April 2022
- Fixed bug with FilePerChannel digital ins/outs not being indexed correctly.
- Increase max number of columns to 16.
- Put waveform display in a scroll area so that when too many columns are present to be displayed at once, a scroll bar can be used.

* Version 3.1.0, 3 June 2022
- Fixed memory issue that caused systems with multiple RHD2216 chips to erroneously duplicate channels.
- Added Plotting Mode options in the Performance menu, including a new High Efficiency mode that plots data more efficiently.
- Allowed some elements (including window size, position, and control panel state) of the basic GUI appearance to automatically load/save through QSettings.
- Added current channel name to the Window Title of the Spike Scope, ISI, PSTH, and Spectrogram tools.
- Added current loaded filename to the Window Title of the Probe Map tool.
