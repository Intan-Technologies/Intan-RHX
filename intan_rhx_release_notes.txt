- Fixed bug that sometimes causes crashing when PC audio was enabled.
- Fixed bug that did not display auxiliary inputs or supply voltages from second headstage when dual headstage adapter was used.
- Expanded OpenCL compatibility to fix problems with OpenCL initialization on some systems.

* Version 3.0.4, 5 August 2021
- Fixed small memory leak that occurred when saving in the File Per Signal Type file format.
- Improved XML settings file parsing so that files that don't include any headstage channels can still be correctly loaded.
- Minor improvement to make error logging more detailed and efficient.
- Modify episodic triggered recording algorithm to ignore brief trigger-off events.
- Improved optimum SPI delay finding algorithm so that setting delay manually is less likely to be necessary.
- In data file playback mode, electrode impedances are now displayed.
- Fixed issue with external fast settling in RHD systems not properly triggering as a result of digital input activity

* Version 3.0.5, 3 February 2022
- Removed unused Context Help buttons from dialogs.
- Reduced latency of spike .dat file writing so that these files are updated as soon as spikes are detected.
- Added option to start software without OpenCL.
- Improved TCP parsing to handle unexpected whitespace in a string of commands.
- Added WriteToDiskLatency setting for users to control.
- Added CreateNewDirectory setting for users to control.
- Fixed displaying 'save to disk' icon for enabled non-amplifier signals (e.g., aux in, digital in, analog in).
- Fixed small memory leak during TCP data streaming.
- Altered 'Rescan Ports' behavior so that if the system went from no headstages to at least one detected, the displayed port will update to the present chip(s).
- Added drag'n'drop option for various settings files.
- Added more descriptive error messages when a Probe Map file is loaded as a general settings file.
- Fixed bug that would only flag channels as spike-TCP enabled if they were also waveform-TCP enabled.
- Removed unusable 'aux in wideband' checkbox hidden for RHS systems, because they don't have aux in channels.
- Added more descriptive error/warning messages when channels loaded from XML file are inconsistent with those currently plugged in.
- Fixed bug where loading data for playback that had aux inputs saved in wideband file wouldn't parse correctly.
- Fixed bug with external fast settling not properly triggering as a result of digital input activity.

* Version 3.0.6, 1 April 2022
- Fixed bug with FilePerChannel digital ins/outs not being indexed correctly.
- Increase max number of columns to 16.
- Put waveform display in a scroll area so that when too many columns are present to be displayed at once, a scroll bar can be used.

* Version 3.1.0, 3 June 2022
- Fixed memory issue that caused systems with multiple RHD2216 chips to erroneously duplicate channels.
- Added Plotting Mode options in the Performance menu, including a new High Efficiency mode that plots data more efficiently.
- Allowed some elements (including window size, position, and control panel state) of the basic GUI appearance to automatically load/save through QSettings.
- Added current channel name to the Window Title of the Spike Scope, ISI, PSTH, and Spectrogram tools.
- Added current loaded filename to the Window Title of the Probe Map tool.

* Version 3.2.0, 6 March 2023
- Allow user to specify which port(s) to read data from in Advanced dialog
- For One File Per Channel file format, when playing back data as it's being written, allow for jumping to the end of data for near-real-time playback
- Support for use of XEM7310 board in Intan controllers to replace XEM6010 and XEM6310
- Allow user to specify use of median instead of average for reference calculations
- Fix various issues with re-recorded playback data dropping data blocks at the end
- Allow user to specify whether or not to use max # of channels possible in synth mode
- Add "Get CurrentTimestamp" and "Get CurrentTimeSeconds" TCP commands
- Improved error detection and reporting for TCP commands
- Various improvements in RHX API including easier use of the API without Qt, and additional utility functions described in Rhythm and RhythmStim documentation.

* Version 3.3.0, 23 August 2023
- Improve TCP reception of commands to not duplicate slot connections
- Add Chip Test Mode
- Fix issue where for RHD chips, Rescan Ports would not run chip calibration
- Fix 7310 bit files so that for RHS systems, using a sample rate other than default (30 kHz) will no longer cause the software to use the wrong sample rate.
- Fix crashing when attempting to open a new file for recording fails, instead display an error message and stop acquisition.

* Version 3.3.1, 5 December 2023
- Add 10, 16, and 20 ms time scale options for Spike Scope
- Fix intermittent Stim Parameters dialog initialization issue that could cause incorrect values to appear
- Append date/timestamp to end of LiveNotes filename to avoid unintentional file overwriting for multi-file recording sessions
- Improve TCP functionality to allow for multiple connections/disconnections to occur without having to restart software
- Add TCP "execute" commands: SaveSettingsFile, LoadSettingsFile, SaveStimulationSettingsFile, LoadStimulationSettingsFile, analogous to already present UI elements.
- Improve test mode: wider acceptable input signal ranges, reduced likelihood of unintentionally entering test mode, and faster chip testing

* Version 3.3.2, 8 July 2024
- Improve chip testing mode, and give a more direct warning against using chip test mode for headstages
- Flush livenotes file every time a livenote occurs (useful for real-time applications that rely on livenotes)
- Fix XML loading of Port-specific parameters (manual delay, auxiliary digital out assignment) failing after Port A
- Fix intermittent crashing that would occur from hovering cursor in tooltip mode over border between signal types in plot
